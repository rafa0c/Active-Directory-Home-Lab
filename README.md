# 🛡️ Active Directory Home Lab

## 🎯 Objective
[Brief Objective]

The Active Directory Home Lab project focused on setting up and securing an AD environment to simulate real-world enterprise scenarios. The lab provided hands-on experience in managing domains, users, and group policies, as well as configuring secure authentication methods like Kerberos and enforcing least-privilege access. By simulating common AD attacks (e.g., pass-the-hash, golden ticket), the lab also demonstrated detection techniques and incident response strategies. This project significantly improved my understanding of AD architecture, security hardening, and monitoring practices to safeguard critical infrastructure.
