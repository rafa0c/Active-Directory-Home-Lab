## üéØ Objective
[Brief Objective]

The Active Directory Home Lab project focused on setting up and securing an AD environment to simulate real-world enterprise scenarios. The lab provided hands-on experience in managing domains, users, and group policies, as well as configuring secure authentication methods like Kerberos and enforcing least-privilege access. By simulating common AD attacks (e.g., pass-the-hash, golden ticket), the lab also demonstrated detection techniques and incident response strategies. This project significantly improved my understanding of AD architecture, security hardening, and monitoring practices to safeguard critical infrastructure.

### üí° Skills Learned
[Bullet Points]

- Active Directory Management: Expertise in domain and user management, group policies, and AD architecture.
- Authentication Security: Configured secure authentication protocols such as Kerberos, NTLM, and MFA.
- Privilege Management: Implemented least-privilege policies and monitored for privilege escalation.
- Security Hardening: Applied AD hardening techniques by minimizing attack surfaces and enforcing security policies.
- Threat Detection & Response: Simulated attacks and developed detection and incident response strategies.
- Log Analysis: Monitored AD using tools like Event Viewer, Sysmon, and PowerShell for anomaly detection and auditing.

### üõ†Ô∏è Tools Used
[Bullet Points]

- Windows Server: Set up and configured Active Directory, including Domain Controllers (DC), Group Policy, and DNS services.
- PowerShell: Automated AD management tasks, such as user creation, policy enforcement, and security monitoring.
- Windows Event Viewer: Monitored and analyzed security logs for detecting abnormal behavior or attack attempts.
- LDAP (Lightweight Directory Access Protocol): Used for managing and querying AD objects and authentication services.
- Microsoft RSAT (Remote Server Administration Tools): Administered AD components, such as Group Policy Management and DNS, remotely.
- Virtualization Software (VMware/VirtualBox): Created virtual environments for testing AD configurations and attacks.
- MITRE ATT&CK Framework: Used as a reference for simulating real-world attack techniques and tactics within the AD environment.
